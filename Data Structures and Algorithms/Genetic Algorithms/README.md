# Genetic Algorithms in Problem Solving

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of genetic algorithms (GAs) applied to solve various problems. Genetic algorithms are a family of optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection. They are commonly used to find solutions for complex, non-linear, and multi-objective optimization problems. This collection demonstrates the application of GAs to address different problem domains.


## Problem Domains
- [Knapsack Problem](./knapsack/): Applying GAs to find the best combination of items within a weight limit.
