# Realtime Emotion Detector using Python (Google's Teachable Machine Learning)

## 🛠️ Description
This project is about developing a system that can detect the emotions of a person in realtime from the video on the basis of a pre-trained **keras** model. This model was trained using Google's [Teachable Machine Learning](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/). 

The project can detect the following emotions:- 
**Angry**, **Happy**, **Sad**, **Smile**, **Surprise**


## ⚙️ Languages or Frameworks Used
 - Python, Mediapipe, Keras
 - Teachable Machine Learning (For model training)


## 🌟 How to run
 - ### Install all the requirements
    Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the requirements.

-  ###  Run the project
    To the run the project, go to the terminal and run `python main.py`. This will popup two windows, one for capturing the `video input` and the other for displyaing the `emotion output.`
    
 > Note: The Model (.h5 file) has been trained using the Teachable Machine Learning which is an esay to use ML Training Platform by **Google**. Do checkout that platform.
